Italy covers an area of 301,338&nbsp;km2&nbsp;(116,347&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and has a largely&nbsp;temperate seasonal&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mediterranean climate. Due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as&nbsp;lo Stivale&nbsp;(the&nbsp;Boot).[14][15]&nbsp;With around 61 million inhabitants it is the&nbsp;fourth most populous EU member state.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span class=\"ql-size-small\">Since&nbsp;classical times, ancient&nbsp;Phoenicians,&nbsp;Carthaginians&nbsp;and&nbsp;Greeks&nbsp;established settlements in the&nbsp;south of Italy, with&nbsp;Etruscans&nbsp;and&nbsp;Celts&nbsp;inhabiting the&nbsp;centre&nbsp;and the&nbsp;north&nbsp;of Italy respectively and various&nbsp;ancient Italian tribes&nbsp;and&nbsp;Italic peoples&nbsp;dispersed throughout the Italian Peninsula and&nbsp;insular Italy. The&nbsp;Italic tribe&nbsp;known as the&nbsp;Latins&nbsp;formed the&nbsp;Roman Kingdom, which eventually became a&nbsp;republic&nbsp;that&nbsp;conquered&nbsp;and&nbsp;assimilated&nbsp;other nearby civilisations. Ultimately the&nbsp;Roman Empire&nbsp;emerged as the dominant power in the&nbsp;Mediterranean basin, conquering much of the&nbsp;ancient world&nbsp;and becoming the leading cultural, political and religious&nbsp;centre&nbsp;of&nbsp;Western civilisation. The&nbsp;legacy of the Roman Empire&nbsp;is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of&nbsp;civilian law,&nbsp;republican governments, Christianity and the&nbsp;Latin script.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span class=\"ql-size-small\">During the&nbsp;Early Middle Ages, Italy suffered&nbsp;sociopolitical collapse&nbsp;amid calamitous&nbsp;barbarian invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous rival&nbsp;city-states&nbsp;and&nbsp;maritime republics, mainly in the northern and central regions of Italy, rose to great prosperity through shipping, commerce and banking, laying down the groundwork for modern capitalism.[16]&nbsp;These mostly independent statelets, acting as Europe's main&nbsp;spice trade&nbsp;hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy and wealth in comparison to the larger&nbsp;feudal&nbsp;monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe at the time, though much of central Italy remained under the control of the&nbsp;theocratic&nbsp;Papal States, while Southern Italy remained largely feudal until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession of&nbsp;Byzantine,&nbsp;Arab,&nbsp;Norman,&nbsp;Angevin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Spanish&nbsp;conquests of the region.[17]</span></p><p><br></p><p><span class=\"ql-size-small\">The&nbsp;Renaissance&nbsp;began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in&nbsp;humanism,&nbsp;science,&nbsp;exploration&nbsp;and&nbsp;art. Italian culture flourished at this time, producing famous scholars, artists and&nbsp;polymaths&nbsp;such as&nbsp;Leonardo da Vinci,&nbsp;Michelangelo,&nbsp;Galileo&nbsp;and&nbsp;Machiavelli. Since Middle Age, Italian explorers such as&nbsp;Marco Polo,&nbsp;Christopher Columbus,&nbsp;Amerigo Vespucci,&nbsp;John Cabot&nbsp;and&nbsp;Giovanni da Verrazzanodiscovered new routes to the Far East and the&nbsp;New World, helping to usher in the European&nbsp;Age of Discovery. Nevertheless, Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of the&nbsp;Atlantic trade route&nbsp;and the route to the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope, both of which bypassed the Mediterranean.[17][18][19]&nbsp;Furthermore, the Italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare, culminating in the&nbsp;Italian Wars&nbsp;of the 15th and 16th centuries that left them exhausted, with no one emerging as a dominant power. The weakened Italian sovereigns soon fell victim to conquest by&nbsp;European powers&nbsp;such as&nbsp;France,&nbsp;Spain&nbsp;and&nbsp;Austria.</span></p><p><span class=\"ql-size-small\">By the mid-19th century, a rising movement in support of&nbsp;Italian nationalism&nbsp;and independence from foreign control led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the&nbsp;Risorgimento, which sought the formation of a unified nation-state. After various unsuccessful attempts, the&nbsp;Italian Wars of Independence, the&nbsp;Expedition of the Thousand&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Capture of Rome&nbsp;resulted in the eventual&nbsp;unification&nbsp;of the country, now a&nbsp;great power&nbsp;after centuries of foreign domination and political division.[20]&nbsp;From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the new&nbsp;Kingdom of Italy&nbsp;rapidly industrialised, although mainly in the north, and acquired a&nbsp;colonial empire,[21]&nbsp;while&nbsp;the south&nbsp;remained largely impoverished and&nbsp;excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential&nbsp;diaspora.[22]&nbsp;Despite being one of the&nbsp;main victors&nbsp;in World War I, Italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading the way to the rise of a&nbsp;fascist&nbsp;dictatorship in 1922. The subsequent participation in World War II on the&nbsp;Axis&nbsp;side ended in military defeat, economic destruction and an&nbsp;Italian civil war. Following the&nbsp;liberation of Italy&nbsp;and the rise of the&nbsp;resistance, the country abolished the&nbsp;monarchy, reinstated democracy, enjoyed a prolonged&nbsp;economic boom&nbsp;and, despite periods of sociopolitical turmoil (e.g.&nbsp;Anni di piombo,&nbsp;Mani pulite, the&nbsp;Second Mafia War, the&nbsp;Maxi Trial&nbsp;and subsequent assassinations of&nbsp;anti-mafia&nbsp;officials), became a major&nbsp;advanced economy.[23][24][25]</span></p><p><br></p><p><span class=\"ql-size-small\">Today Italy has the third largest nominal GDP in the&nbsp;Eurozone&nbsp;and the eighth&nbsp;largest in the world. As an advanced economy the country also has the sixth worldwide&nbsp;national wealth&nbsp;and it is ranked third for its central bank&nbsp;gold reserve. Italy has a very high level of&nbsp;human development&nbsp;and it is sixth in the world for&nbsp;life expectancy. The country plays a prominent role in regional and global economic, military, cultural and diplomatic affairs, and it is both a&nbsp;regional power[26][27]&nbsp;and a&nbsp;great power.[28][29]&nbsp;Italy is a&nbsp;founding&nbsp;and&nbsp;leading&nbsp;member of the&nbsp;European Union&nbsp;and the member of numerous international institutions, including the&nbsp;UN,&nbsp;NATO, the&nbsp;OECD, the&nbsp;OSCE, the&nbsp;WTO, the&nbsp;G7,&nbsp;G20, the&nbsp;Union for the Mediterranean, the&nbsp;Council of Europe,&nbsp;Uniting for Consensus&nbsp;and&nbsp;many more. As a reflection of its cultural wealth, Italy is home to 53&nbsp;World Heritage Sites, the most in the world, and is the fifth&nbsp;most visited country.</span></p><br/><p class=\"ql-size-small\">from Wikipedia</p>",
